Descriptioin:
- Radiation Localizatoin and Forensics

Purpose:
- Process, analyze and visualize data from unmanned vehicles.
- Overlay output image via Google Earth to identify regions of radioactivity and locate source.
- Use geostatistical estimator to identify probable radioisotope.

Improvements:
- Improve algorithm performance, reduce cost to allow for processing larger data files. (Rewrite in C++)
- Creat UI for operator to interact with data visualization.
- Decentralized code, add flexiblitity.
